            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><span class="li">Prepare a large pot with a steamer basket and add about 1 inch of water to the
                        pot.</span></li>
                <br>
                <li><span class="li">ut the potatoes into quarters and add them to the steamer basket. Turn the heat to
                        medium-high and bring the water to a simmer. Cover the pot with a lid, reduce the heat to
                        medium-low, and steam the potatoes for 15-20 minutes or until they are completely tender.</span>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><span class="li">Transfer the potatoes to your work surface and let them sit until they are cool
                        enough to handle, about 5 minutes. Then, peel off the skins and transfer the potatoes to a large
                        bowl.</span></li>
                <br>
                <li><span class="li">Mash the potatoes with a pestle or masher until the mixture is relatively
                        homogenous. Don’t worry if there are a few chunks.</span> </li>
                <br>
                <li><span class="li">Add 2 tablespoons of butter to a large skillet or wok. Begin heating the butter
                        over medium-high heat. Once frothy, add the onions and mushrooms, cook for 3-4 minutes or until
                        the onions have become slightly tender.</span></li>
                <br>
                <li><span class="li"><span class="li">Add the garlic and continue cooking the mixture until everything
                            is lightly browned and completely tender, about 4-5 minutes.</span></li>
                <br>
                <li><span class="li">Transfer the mushroom mixture to the mixing bowl with the potatoes. Add the salt
                        and knead the mixture by hand for 4-5 minutes.</span> </li>
                <br>
                <li><span class="li">Place a large sheet of plastic wrap over your work surface. Add the filling to the
                        center of the sheet. Shape the filling into an even mound and then wrap it tightly in the
                        plastic wrap.</span></li>
                <br>
                <li><span class="li">Refrigerate the filling for 20-30 minutes.</span></li>
                <br>
                <li><span class="li">Meanwhile, place another large sheet of plastic wrap (this may require two sheets
                        for the width) onto your work surface. Shingle 7 pieces of thick cut bacon in the center of the
                        plastic wrap, then lay 5 pieces of bacon perpendicular to the original slices on top. This
                        should create a cross pattern.</span></li>
                <br>
                <li><span class="li">Place the chilled filling in the center of the bacon slices and then wrap the bacon
                        around the filling. If there is a gap at the top of the<br>
                        filling, add another piece of bacon to completely cover it.</span> </li>
                <br>
                <li><span class="li">Wrap the ‘pork roast’ in the plastic wrap and refrigerate it for 10-15
                        minutes.</span></li>
                <br>
                <li><span class="li">Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 400 °F and prepare a small rimmed baking sheet with
                        an inlaid rack.</span></li>
                <br>
                <li><span class="li">Cut 4 lengths of butcher’s twine, about 10 inches in length. Place one piece
                        horizontally on the rack and then the other three pieces vertically.<br>
                        The pieces of butcher’s twine should be roughly equidistant from each other.</span></li>
                <br>
                <li><span class="li">Place the chilled ‘pork roast’ seam-side down on the rack, then loosely tie the
                        pieces of twine around it. This is just to keep the bacon from moving<br>
                        during the cooking process, so it doesn’t need to be very tight.</span></li>
                <br>
                <li><span class="li">Place the pieces of rosemary underneath the pieces of twine.</span></li>
                <br>
                <li><span class="li">Bake the ‘pork roast’ for 30-40 minutes, or until the bacon is well browned.</span>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><span class="li">Allow the ‘pork roast’ to rest for 10 minutes.</span></li>
                <br>
                <li><span class="li">Meanwhile, begin heating a large high-sided skillet over medium-high heat.</span>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><span class="li">Add the red wine, sake, and soy sauce. Cook until the sauce has reduced by half,
                        about 4-5 minutes.</span> </li>
                <br>
                <li><span class="li">Reduce the heat to low and add the remaining 2 tablespoons of cold butter. Whisk
                        constantly until the sauce is glossy, thickened, and the butter has completely melted.</span>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><span class="li">Transfer the ‘pork roast’ to the serving dish of your choice, then pour the sauce
                        over the roast.</span> </li>
                <br>
                <li><span class="li">Garnish the ‘pork roast’ with some watercress and serve immediately.</span></li>
