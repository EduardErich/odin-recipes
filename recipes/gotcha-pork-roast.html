            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare a large pot with a steamer basket and add about 1 inch of water to the pot.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Cut the potatoes into quarters and add them to the steamer basket. Turn the heat to medium-high and bring the water to a simmer.<br>
                Cover the pot with a lid, reduce the heat to medium-low, and steam the potatoes for 15-20 minutes or until they are completely tender.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Transfer the potatoes to your work surface and let them sit until they are cool enough to handle, about 5 minutes. Then, peel off the<br>
                skins and transfer the potatoes to a large bowl.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Mash the potatoes with a pestle or masher until the mixture is relatively homogenous. Don’t worry if there are a few chunks. </li>
                <br>
                <li>Add 2 tablespoons of butter to a large skillet or wok. Begin heating the butter over medium-high heat. Once frothy, add the onions and<br>
                mushrooms, cook for 3-4 minutes or until the onions have become slightly tender.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Add the garlic and continue cooking the mixture until everything is lightly browned and completely tender, about 4-5 minutes.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Transfer the mushroom mixture to the mixing bowl with the potatoes. Add the salt and knead the mixture by hand for 4-5 minutes. </li>
                <br>
                <li>Place a large sheet of plastic wrap over your work surface. Add the filling to the center of the sheet. Shape the filling into an even<br>
                mound and then wrap it tightly in the plastic wrap. </li>
                <br>
                <li>Refrigerate the filling for 20-30 minutes.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Meanwhile, place another large sheet of plastic wrap (this may require two sheets for the width) onto your work surface. Shingle 7 pieces<br>
                of thick cut bacon in the center of the plastic wrap, then lay 5 pieces of bacon perpendicular to the original slices on top. This should create<br>
                a cross pattern.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Place the chilled filling in the center of the bacon slices and then wrap the bacon around the filling. If there is a gap at the top of the<br>
                filling, add another piece of bacon to completely cover it. </li>
                <br>
                <li>Wrap the ‘pork roast’ in the plastic wrap and refrigerate it for 10-15 minutes.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 400 °F and prepare a small rimmed baking sheet with an inlaid rack.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Cut 4 lengths of butcher’s twine, about 10 inches in length. Place one piece horizontally on the rack and then the other three pieces vertically.<br>
                The pieces of butcher’s twine should be roughly equidistant from each other. </li>
                <br>
                <li>Place the chilled ‘pork roast’ seam-side down on the rack, then loosely tie the pieces of twine around it. This is just to keep the bacon from moving<br>
                during the cooking process, so it doesn’t need to be very tight. </li>
                <br>
                <li>Place the pieces of rosemary underneath the pieces of twine.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Bake the ‘pork roast’ for 30-40 minutes, or until the bacon is well browned. </li>
                <br>
                <li>Allow the ‘pork roast’ to rest for 10 minutes.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Meanwhile, begin heating a large high-sided skillet over medium-high heat. </li>
                <br>
                <li>Add the red wine, sake, and soy sauce. Cook until the sauce has reduced by half, about 4-5 minutes. </li>
                <br>
                <li>Reduce the heat to low and add the remaining 2 tablespoons of cold butter. Whisk constantly until the sauce is glossy, thickened, and the butter has<br>
                completely melted. </li>
                <br>
                <li>Transfer the ‘pork roast’ to the serving dish of your choice, then pour the sauce over the roast. </li>
                <br>
                <li>Garnish the ‘pork roast’ with some watercress and serve immediately.</li>
